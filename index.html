          <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Levani, a passionate front-end web
            developer. I'm a first-year IT student at the University of Business
            and Technology. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and
            Styled Components. I've always wanted to create something useful,
            meaningful, and visually appealing, which is why I started learning
            front-end development two years ago. I began my programming journey
            with a simple game called "Karel the Dog," and it immediately
            captured my interest. I would spend 7-8 hours a day playing it. I
            find immense satisfaction in implementing solutions for various
            problems, identifying the source of bugs, and resolving them. At
            different points in my journey, I faced challenges, including the
            demands of school, technical issues, or moments of boredom. However,
            I always returned to continue learning. Today, I've developed a
            strong coding habit. I make it a point to practice coding every day,
            regardless of any obstacles. This commitment is what continually
            drives my improvement as a developer. Apart from coding, my hobbies
            include playing video games, listening to and playing music, and
            staying active with fitness. These activities provide a balanced and
            enjoyable life outside of coding.

            <h3>Spotify Clone</h3>
            <p>
              The Spotify Clone project closely mimics Spotify's design and
              essential features, with the exception of certain functionalities
              not accessible through the Spotify API. It was my most ambitious
              project completed independently, without the guidance of online
              courses, and it took me one month to build. During this project, I
              encountered and overcame several challenges. One of the main
              difficulties was implementing a music player that allowed users to
              play, pause, rewind, and skip tracks. Additionally, managing the
              application's state, handling routing, and dealing with dynamic
              data were complex tasks. Nevertheless, these challenges provided
              valuable learning experiences and contributed to my growth as a
              developer. For this project, I used React for building the user
              interface and Styled-Components for styling. To manage the global
              state of the application effectively, I utilized React's
              useContext and useReducer hooks.

            <h3>Comfy Sloth</h3>
            <p>
              The Comfy Sloth is a website that encompasses nearly every feature
              of a classic e-commerce website. It includes a landing page,
              products page, authentication, a shopping cart, and a payment
              gateway. This project provided valuable lessons, as I learned how
              an e-commerce website operates. The most challenging aspects were
              implementing the products page with its filtering and sorting
              functionalities, as well as the shopping cart. However, I managed
              them successfully by utilizing React and Styled Components for
              this project. Additionally, I employed useContext and useReducer
              for managing the global state.
