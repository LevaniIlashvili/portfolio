          <p>
            Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Levani, a passionate front-end web
            developer. I'm a first-year IT student at the University of Business
            and Technology. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and
            Styled Components. I've always wanted to create something useful,
            meaningful, and visually appealing, which is why I started learning
            front-end development two years ago. I began my programming journey
            with a simple game called "Karel the Dog," and it immediately
            captured my interest. I would spend 7-8 hours a day playing it. I
            find immense satisfaction in implementing solutions for various
            problems, identifying the source of bugs, and resolving them. At
            different points in my journey, I faced challenges, including the
            demands of school, technical issues, or moments of boredom. However,
            I always returned to continue learning. Today, I've developed a
            strong coding habit. I make it a point to practice coding every day,
            regardless of any obstacles. This commitment is what continually
            drives my improvement as a developer. Apart from coding, my hobbies
            include playing video games, listening to and playing music, and
            staying active with fitness. These activities provide a balanced and
            enjoyable life outside of coding.
